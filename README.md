# LLM preference classification

Reproducible experiments for [LLM Classification Finetuning on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-classification-finetuning).
Predict whether a human prefers response A, response B, or a tie. The primary metric
is multiclass log loss (lower is better).

Our best official Kaggle score is **0.97025**, achieved by the Qwen3-4B QLoRA
preference classifier in attempt 002. Frozen-model confirmation gave **0.96236 log
loss** and **53.06% accuracy** on 5,746 examples. Training stopped at its six-hour
budget after 0.61 epochs; checkpoint 800 was selected on development data.
See [attempt 002 results](ATTEMPT_002_RESULTS.md) and the [protocol](docs/ATTEMPT_002.md).

The completed [dataset/model EDA](EDA_REPORT.md) identifies answer-order sensitivity,
weak tie discrimination, and difficult correctness/constraint comparisons. A small
longer-context inference pilot shows an uncertain gain. See the executed EDA notebooks
for evidence, uncertainty and ranked follow-up experiments.

The [interactive error poster](docs/ERROR_POSTER.md) shows the highest-loss training,
development and local held-out examples, full text, truncation and answer-order
diagnostics. Browse it locally at **http://127.0.0.1:8765/**; full-text artifacts stay
under `~/database`, with aggregate results and reproducible source in this repository.

Attempt 003 tests a **prompted Gemma 4 judge**, with frozen weights and no classifier
blend. See its [protocol](docs/ATTEMPT_003.md) and [current results](ATTEMPT_003_RESULTS.md).

Attempt 001's offline ensemble scored **1.00897** on Kaggle, with a local estimate
of **1.00956**. Its research ensemble achieved **1.00194 holdout log loss** and
**49.63% accuracy**. Always predicting the most frequent training class gives
**34.91% accuracy**. See [attempt 001 results](RESULTS.md) for the vectorizer and
classifier comparison and all baselines.

The first attempt compares TF-IDF, a GRU trained from scratch, and contemporary
Qwen3 embeddings with logistic regression, LightGBM, and neural classifiers.
Additional experiments use response structure, combined representations, and
probability ensembles. See [experiment plan](docs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md) for the
evaluation contract and further approaches.

```bash
uv sync
uv run python scripts/download_data.py
uv run python scripts/run_experiments.py prepare
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Run each stage with `uv run python scripts/run_experiments.py STAGE`, where `STAGE`
is `structural`, `tfidf`, `rnn`, `qwen`, or `hybrid`. Qwen requires extracted
embeddings from `scripts/embed.py`. Read the plan before running the remote
extraction; it transfers competition text to Eliza.

Data, cached vectors, model weights and predictions live under
`~/database/llm_classification_finetuning`. Override with `ARENA_DATA_DIR`.
Notebook files live in `notebooks/`, linked from
`~/notebooks/llm_classification_finetuning`. The repository stores source,
executed notebooks and aggregate results, without raw competition text or credentials.
